# South-African-bank-notes-recognition-system
The aim of bank note recognition is to identify the properties (features) of the depicted bank note in a reference collection of notes. The bank note recognition system should compute a similarity measure between notes that are invariant to sides, scale and rotations, because the bank note has two faces, and the orientation of the note can either be upright or up-side-down. Given all the South African bank notes (both old and new notes): (R10, R20, R50, R100, R200), implement a robust image processing system that can classify each input bank note image, as genuine and denomination (value of the note) appropriately. (Consider both old and new notes, and consider both sides of each note, and length of the note should always be the horizontal side of the image).
